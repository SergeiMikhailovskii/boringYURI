# Dagger extension for Boring YURI

An extension for `Boring Yuri` to provide generated `Uri` factories as injectable [Dagger][1]
dependencies.

To be able to inject the generated `Uri` factories you need to add a generated module in the
application [Component][2] like in the example:

```java
@Singleton
@Component(modules = {
        ...
        BoringYuriModule.class
})
interface AppComponent extends AndroidInjector<MyApplication> {

    @Component.Factory
    abstract class Factory implements AndroidInjector.Factory<MyApplication> {
    }

}
```

**IMPORTANT:** `dagger` component that includes a generated `BoringYuriModule` **can not** be
a Kotlin interface because kapt generates Java stubs for `dagger` annotation processor and
the generated module that is added to `@Component` annotation has not created yet. So to get rid
of the Java stubs generation step we have to make the `Component` a java interface. In this case
`Boring Yuri`'s dagger processor will be able to produce the module file before the `Component`
is compiled. There is an open [issue][GH-7] for this.

When you have the generated `dagger` module included in your application component, you may enjoy
your injectable `Uri` factories:

```java
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Inject
    ContactUriFactory uriFactory;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        AndroidInjection.inject(this);

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ...

        Uri contactUri = uriFactory.buildContactUri(42);
        ...
    }
}
```

## Sample

The detailed example on how to use `dagger` extension for `Boring Yuri` can be found in
[sample-dagger](../dagger-sample).

## Installation

To add `dagger` extension for `Boring Yuri`, include the following in your app module
`build.gradle` file:

With Java only:

```groovy
dependencies {
         ...
  annotationProcessor "org.boringyuri:boringyuri-dagger:1.1.2"
}
```

With Kotlin:

```groovy
dependencies {
        ...
  kapt "org.boringyuri:boringyuri-dagger:1.1.2"
}
```

## Configuration
Dagger extension annotation processor for `Boring Yuri` supports the following configuration
option:

 * `boringyuri.dagger.module` â€“ if the option is not set, the default name of the `dagger`
   generated module is `boringyuri.dagger.BoringYuriModule`. But if you prefer to have the module
   in your own package or would like to give it a different name, you may use this option and
   provide a new fully qualified name that works for you better.
